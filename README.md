# Austras

## Description

Austras is a Java framework designed to simplify the development of applications by generating code for tasks that 
require significant attention to maintenance. It features simple dependency injection (DI), JSON to object conversion, 
and minimalistic REST service support, all running on a plain JVM without bytecode manipulation. 
These are just a few of the many features that Austras offers to enhance your development process.

## Features

- **Dependency Injection (DI):** Simply declare a constructor with parameters, and Austras will generate the code needed 
   to create your object with the required dependencies during compilation.
- **JSON Conversion:** Supports converting JSON to objects and back, with generated code ensuring easy readability and 
   debuggability.
- **Minimalistic REST Services:** Configure endpoints using annotations on methods, and Austras will generate the 
   necessary code. No reflection or bytecode manipulation involved.
- **Code Generation:** Focuses on maintaining code formatting, making the generated code easy to read and debug.

These features are just the beginning; Austras includes many more capabilities designed to streamline your development 
workflow.
