1. SCAN:
   Scan root classes for potential components and providers and add them to the staging.
   Components marked with @Component put to the component map directly instead of staging.

2. LINK:
   Try to find components for every provider (by instantiable class and qualifiers). Move found components to the component map.
   Create "virtual" components for rest of providers. Add these components to the component map.

4. RESOLVE:
   Process dependencies of all providers (component map -> component -> provider)
        1. if the dependency is in component map - do nothing
        2. if the dependency is in staging - move it to component map
        3. if not found - do nothing

5. GENERATE:
   Generate providers for components without providers
